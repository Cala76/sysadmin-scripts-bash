# (and to be added if not exist).

# when started Firefox with --profileManager switch.

# Tested with:
# $ dpkg -l | grep -E '\ bash\ \ |base\-files' 
# ii  base-files                            12.4+deb12u4                        amd64        Debian base system miscellaneous files
# ii  bash                                  5.2.15-2+b2                         amd64        GNU Bourne Again SHell

# Without / at the end!
